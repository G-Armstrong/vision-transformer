# Implementation Plan for Gas State Classification

## Current State Analysis
The current implementation achieves 65% accuracy using a basic CNN architecture. Key limitations identified:

1. **Model Architecture**
   - Simple CNN structure may not capture complex gas state patterns
   - No attention mechanisms (required for improvement)
   - Limited feature extraction capability

2. **Training Setup**
   - Using MSE loss instead of Binary Cross Entropy for classification
   - Basic SGD optimizer without momentum
   - Linear learning rate decay may not be optimal
   - Small validation batch size (4) limits evaluation stability

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Model Architecture
Will implement a Vision Transformer (ViT) based architecture:
- Patch embedding layer to split 28x28 input into patches
- Multi-head self-attention layers to capture global patterns
- Lightweight design considering compute constraints
- Residual connections for better gradient flow
- Layer normalization for training stability

### 2. Training Optimizations
- Switch to Binary Cross Entropy loss
- Use AdamW optimizer with weight decay
- Implement cosine learning rate schedule with warmup
- Increase validation batch size
- Add early stopping to prevent overfitting

### 3. Code Structure Improvements
- Create separate ViT model class
- Implement proper test prediction writing
- Add model checkpointing
- Enhance documentation for the collaborator
- Add type hints and error handling

## Implementation Steps

1. **Model Development** (Priority: High)
   - Create new VisionTransformer class
   - Implement patch embedding
   - Add multi-head attention layers
   - Design classification head

2. **Training Pipeline Updates** (Priority: High)
   - Update loss function
   - Implement new optimizer setup
   - Add learning rate scheduling
   - Add early stopping

3. **Testing & Validation** (Priority: Medium)
   - Implement test prediction writer
   - Add model checkpointing
   - Create validation metrics tracking

4. **Documentation & Code Quality** (Priority: Medium)
   - Add detailed comments for the collaborator
   - Document model architecture choices
   - Add type hints
   - Improve error handling

## Considerations for Collaborator
- Will maintain clear documentation explaining the transformer architecture
- Include comments explaining key concepts
- Keep model size reasonable for given compute constraints
- Focus on code readability and maintainability

## Success Metrics
- Primary: Achieve 83% accuracy on test set
- Secondary: Maintain reasonable training time
- Secondary: Ensure code is well-documented and understandable

## Timeline
Given the "couple of hours" constraint:
1. Model Implementation: 45 minutes
2. Training Pipeline Updates: 30 minutes
3. Testing & Documentation: 45 minutes
