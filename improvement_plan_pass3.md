# Engineering Prompt: Modifications to the Vision Transformer Training Pipeline

## Problem Description
The problem is that the model is memorizing (overfitting) the training examples rather than learning general features. In `run_transformer.py`, the training loop computes loss with:
```python
loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(outputs, labels)
```
and immediately after, gradients are backpropagated with loss.backward(). The near-zero loss on training data suggests the model has essentially memorized these examples.

## Required Changes
1. Enhance Regularization via Batch Normalization and Dropout

Objective:
Introduce Batch Normalization and additional Dropout layers in key parts of the Vision Transformer to mimic the strong regularization of the CNN, while remaining compatible with the ViT architecture.

Modifications in vision_transformer.py:

PatchEmbedding Module:

Change: Add a Batch Normalization layer after the convolutional projection and before rearranging the patches.
Code Example:
```python
class PatchEmbedding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 2, patch_size: int = 4, emb_dim: int = 32):
        super().__init__()
        self.patch_size = patch_size
        self.proj = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, emb_dim, kernel_size=patch_size, stride=patch_size)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(emb_dim)  # Added BatchNorm for regularization
        self.cls_token = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1, 1, emb_dim))
        self.pos_embedding = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1, (28 // patch_size) ** 2 + 1, emb_dim))
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.2)
        
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        x = self.proj(x)
        x = self.bn(x)  # Apply batch normalization to stabilize activations
        x = rearrange(x, 'b e h w -> b (h w) e')
        cls_tokens = repeat(self.cls_token, '() n e -> b n e', b=x.shape[0])
        x = torch.cat((cls_tokens, x), dim=1)
        x = self.dropout(x + self.pos_embedding)
        return x
```

Explanation: Batch normalization after the convolution helps stabilize the activations, reducing the risk of the model memorizing the training data. The existing dropout remains to further regularize the network.
Transformer Block (Optional):

Consideration: You may experiment with adding a BatchNorm layer before or after the attention or MLP components. This should be done cautiously to preserve the transformer’s internal dynamics.

2. Simplify Learning Rate and Optimization Dynamics

Objective:
Switch from AdamW with a warmup cosine schedule to SGD with momentum and a linear decay scheduler to foster better exploration and prevent premature convergence.

Modifications in run_transformer.py:

Optimizer and Scheduler:
Change: Replace the current AdamW optimizer and LambdaLR scheduler with SGD (with momentum) and a LinearLR scheduler.
Code Example:
```python
# Replace this optimizer setup:
# optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate, weight_decay=weight_decay)
# scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR(optimizer, warmup_cosine_schedule)

# With:
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=weight_decay)
scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.LinearLR(optimizer, start_factor=1.0, end_factor=0.1, total_iters=len(train_loader)*epochs)
```

Explanation:
SGD with momentum and a linear decay scheduler can allow the model to explore a more robust solution space before settling, potentially reducing the risk of overfitting due to too cautious or rapid convergence.

3. Explore Alternative Loss Functions
Objective:
Investigate alternative loss functions to see if a more gradual error landscape (i.e., softer gradients) improves generalization.

Modifications in run_transformer.py:

Loss Function Options:
Option A: Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss by comparing the sigmoid-activated outputs to the labels.
Option B: Incorporate label smoothing into BCE with logits.
Code Examples:
```python
loss = F.mse_loss(torch.sigmoid(outputs), labels)
```

# Option B: Use BCE with logits and label smoothing
smoothing_factor = 0.1  # example smoothing factor
smooth_labels = labels * (1 - smoothing_factor) + 0.5 * smoothing_factor
loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(outputs, smooth_labels)
Explanation:
MSE loss or label smoothing can produce a more gradual error landscape, reducing the steep gradients that might push the model into memorizing the training examples too quickly.

Summary
Regularization: Add BatchNorm and additional Dropout layers in the ViT (especially in the PatchEmbedding module) to mimic the CNN’s robust regularization.
Optimization: Replace AdamW with SGD with momentum and adopt a linear learning rate decay to avoid rapid convergence and premature memorization.
Loss Function: Experiment with MSE loss or label smoothing as alternatives to BCE with logits to achieve a more gradual gradient profile.
Follow these instructions to adjust the model training pipeline and evaluate the changes to improve generalization.
